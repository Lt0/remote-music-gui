remote-music-gui
================

  It's a remote control application which used to control the music played in raspberry by PC(linux).
  It include the music list(auto create by music folders in raspberry), 
basic control (stop, pause, play, next, pre, progress bar, volume adjustment), show music info and lyric show.
  It was written by C and GTK, compiled by gnu toolchain in linux.
  I just run it in ubuntu, cent os and openSUSE but it should be easy to compile in windows and run.
